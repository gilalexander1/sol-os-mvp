Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
```

### Database Architecture
```yaml
Primary Database: PostgreSQL 15
Connection: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with connection pooling
Migrations: Alembic for schema management
Schemas: sol-os-mvp_* tables with shared ecosystem patterns
Indexing: Optimized for common query patterns
Backup: Automated backup strategy (production)
```

### Infrastructure Architecture
```yaml
Development: Docker Compose with unique ports
Database: Shared PostgreSQL instance with project-specific schemas
Caching: Shared Redis instance
Reverse Proxy: Nginx for development routing
Monitoring: Health check endpoints
Deployment: Docker-based deployment strategy
```

## Integration Architecture

### Ecosystem Integration
- **Shared Design System**: Import components from ecosystem library
- **Database Patterns**: Follow established schema conventions
- **Authentication**: Consistent JWT implementation across projects
- **Infrastructure**: Integrate with shared Docker Compose services

### BMAD Integration
- **Documentation**: Complete BMAD documentation structure
- **Quality Gates**: Automated and manual quality validation
- **Decision Tracking**: Architecture decisions recorded and auditable
- **Learning Integration**: Patterns contribute to ecosystem knowledge

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with 30-minute expiration and refresh capability
- bcrypt password hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- Role-based access control where applicable
- Secure session management with Redis storage

### Data Protection
- Input validation using Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy ORM
- CORS configuration for appropriate origins
- Environment variable security (no secrets in code)

### Development Security
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Secure development practices enforcement
- Regular security updates and patches

## Performance Architecture

### Backend Performance
- Asynchronous request handling with FastAPI
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Background task processing for heavy operations

### Frontend Performance
- Next.js optimization features (automatic code splitting, image optimization)
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
- Performance monitoring and optimization tracking

### Scalability Considerations
- Stateless application design for horizontal scaling
- Database indexing strategy for query optimization
- Caching strategy for reduced database load
- Load balancer ready configuration

## Quality Architecture

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Automated testing with pytest (backend) and Jest (frontend)
- Code coverage tracking and reporting

### Architecture Quality
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Dependency injection for testability
- Modular design for maintainability
- Documentation generation and maintenance

### BMAD Quality Integration
- **Build**: Automated setup and configuration validation
- **Measure**: Performance metrics and quality score tracking
- **Analyze**: Code quality trends and architecture compliance
- **Decide**: Data-driven improvements and optimizations

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **FastAPI**: Automatic API documentation, excellent Python typing support
- **Next.js 15**: Modern React framework with excellent developer experience
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with ecosystem integration
- **TypeScript**: Enhanced code quality and better development experience

### Architecture Pattern Decisions
- **API-First Design**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable components with consistent design system
- **Schema-First Database**: Well-defined data models with migrations
- **Configuration-Driven**: Environment-specific configuration management

## Monitoring and Observability
