## Predictive Mood Tracker for Sol OS MVP

Building a "smarter" feature is what will truly make Sol OS MVP a powerful, unique tool. This goes beyond simple data logging and moves into **predictive analytics**â€”a core concept in modern AI.

The best way to approach this is to break the problem into three logical, sequential phases. This is a perfect example of a complex feature that needs to be broken down into smaller pieces (stories) for the BMAD workflow.

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Context

Before the app can get "smarter," it needs to collect the right data. The system has to learn what influences your mood and energy.

* **Mood & Energy Logging:** You've already got a basic feature. Now, you need to collect more detailed, consistent data.
* **Contextual Data:** This is the most crucial part. The system needs to know *what else was happening* when you logged your mood. You can include data points like:
    * Time of day
    * Tasks you were working on
    * Weather or temperature
    * Physical activity (if you can get it from a health API)
    * Previous meals or caffeine intake

This contextual data is what the system will use to find patterns and make predictions.


### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis & Prediction

This is where the machine learning comes in. The system will process the data from Phase 1 to find correlations and build a predictive model.

* **Finding Patterns:** The system will look for connections, such as:
    * "My mood rating tends to drop at 3 PM every day."
    * "My energy is highest 30 minutes after I finish a focus session."
    * "Certain tasks are consistently associated with a drop in my focus."
* **Predictive Model:** Once enough patterns are found, the system can begin to predict. It could use a simple statistical model or a more complex machine learning algorithm.

For example, based on historical data, the system could predict: "Your energy is predicted to drop in 45 minutes. It may be a good time to take a break soon."


### Phase 3: Actionable Suggestions & Notifications

This is the final phase where the intelligence is made useful to you.

* **Intelligent Notifications:** Instead of generic reminders, the app will offer smart check-ins based on its predictions. For example, "Your energy tends to dip around this time. Want to take a 5-minute break?" or "Looks like you finished your top-priority task. How do you feel?"
* **Personalized Suggestions:** Based on your mood, the system can offer suggestions. If it predicts a drop in focus, it could suggest a specific activity from a list of things that have helped you in the past. If you log a low-energy mood, it could suggest a short, low-energy task from your to-do list.
