#### Objective
Build a standalone journaling feature within the SolOS application that allows for free-form writing and saving of conversation snippets with Sol.

#### User Story
As a Sol OS MVP user, I want a dedicated space to write my thoughts freely. I also want to be able to save parts of my conversations with Sol to this journal so that I can easily reflect on them later.

#### Technical Requirements
1.  **Journal Interface:** Create a simple, clean, and distraction-free interface where users can write journal entries.
2.  **Entry Management:** Implement the ability to create, edit, save, and delete journal entries.
3.  **Conversation-to-Journal:** Add a function to the chat interface that allows users to select a portion of their conversation with Sol and save it as a new journal entry.
4.  **Database:** Store all journal entries in the project's database. Entries should be associated with the user's ID to ensure privacy.
5.  **Data Security:** All journal entries must be stored securely and be private to the user.
